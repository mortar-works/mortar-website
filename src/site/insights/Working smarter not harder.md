> Information can tell us everything. It has all the answers. But they are answers to questions we have not asked, and which doubtless don't even arise. - Jean Baudrillard

Knowing what question to ask is not straight forward. Our experience of services is defined by just a few key decision making moments. Being able to ask the right question at the right time, and knowing how to respond, therefore defines both service efficiency and effectiveness. 

Today with such huge amounts of information available our decisions are not necessarily any better informed. They are in fact significantly more at risk of being comprimised. Instead of the volume of information availabile, it is the quality of information available at the point of making decisions that is the most important factor in driving service provision. 

Service design is therefore driven not just by enabling decisions to be made in the most efficient manner, but by ensuring our users and customers have the best opportunity to experience the most effective result. 

This is why digitalising processes, and in particular applying intelligence to decision making, is so impactful. It is capable of driving incredible efficiencies in service provision. It makes decision making more dynamic, raising completely different questions to ask, and presenting totally new and alternative methods of delivering services. 

At Mortar our service design methods apply new practices of predictive and behavioural analytics. Our aim is to transform how large volumes of information can be best utilised, so key decision makers, our officers and case-workers, have the most powerful tools at their disposal to help users and customers in their journey.
