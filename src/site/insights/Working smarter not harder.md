> Information can tell us everything. It has all the answers. But they are answers to questions we have not asked, and which doubtless don't even arise. - Jean Baudrillard

Knowing what question to ask is not straight forward. Our experience of services is defined by just a few key decision making moments. Being able to ask the right question at the right time, and being given the right options in response, drives both service efficiency and effectiveness. 

Today with such huge amounts of information available our decisions are not any better informed. They are instead much more easily comprimised. Instead of the volume of information, it is the quality of information available at the point of making decisions that is the most important factor in improving service provision. 

Service design is not just about enabling decisions to be made in the most efficient manner, it is about ensuring users and customers have the best opportunity to experience the most effective service. 

This is why digitalising processes, and in particular applying intelligence to decision making, is so impactful. It is capable of driving incredible efficiencies in service provision, by making decision making more dynamic, transparent and equitable; raising completely different questions to be asked, and presenting totally new and alternative options in how services are best delivered. 

At Mortar our service design methods apply new methods of predictive and behavioural analytics to inform what decisions can be both offered and made. Our framework applies intelligence, machine learning and automation to understand how large volumes of information can be best utilised, so that both users and key decision makers have the most powerful tools at their disposal to aid them in their journeys.
