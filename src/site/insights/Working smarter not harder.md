> Information can tell us everything. It has all the answers. But they are answers to questions we have not asked, and which doubtless don't even arise. - Jean Baudrillard

It is easy to dismiss digital exclusion. Those that don't have the capability, capacity or the interest to participate in society's digital movement are easily overlooked and obscured from view. Our implicit belief in technology's social narrative is that everyone will eventually become included; everyone will soon acquire, through the technology itself, the capacity and the capability to participate.

Exclusion, however, always persists.
