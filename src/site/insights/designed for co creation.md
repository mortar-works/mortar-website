> Coming together is a beginning. Keeping together is progress. Working together is success. â€“ Henry Ford.  

The building of Mortar's framework and tools is a constant process and one that benefits tremendously from being able to support our customers and their users in collaborating and co-creating solutions to the real world problems they encounter. We have built Mortar's core framework to be able to support this process of co-creation, to make available more affordably and more flexibly the exciting new tools and technologies that are driving digital transformation. 

Alongside our core system sits a growing suite of customisable modules and tools that grow in their development and sophistication with each new project and custom implementation. With our clients we collaborate in the co-design and delivery of the specific tools and interfaces that their users need, to drive as much impact as possible in transforming legacy systems and improving the quality and efficiency of the services they deliver.
