Our work with Hackney Council began in response to difficulties that had arisen in community and cultural signposting for older residents. 
The councilâ€™s capacity for administering their free membership and communication service for older residents, Hackney Circle, active since 2014, 
needed to be increased to ensure the quality of service could be maintained. 

The new system we co-created using Hoop'd is now supporting both its users and its owners in creating more accessible forms of information; 
increasing engagement success and significantly broadening the range and reach of the membership. 
It has also streamlined the processes involved in capturing event based information from a growing network of over thirty cultural, 
community and voluntary sector organisations from across the borough.

The creation and management of this network is important for two reasons:

**Firstly** it resolves issues in the regular and uniform communication of Hackney Circle's 
core offer to its members. Overcoming several of the problems that had been restricing the quality and the growth of the service. 

**Secondly** it enables Hackney Circle as a product the ability to generate and offer its own data set as a source of accurate and up-to-date local area information to 
front line local authority staff; as a stand alone service, as well as through integrating with the existing products being used.


The case for investing in hyperlocal and niche signposting  
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The digital development of Hackney Circle has therefore enabled the service to both improve and amplify its offer, whilst cementing its role in the delivery of key strategic priorities and initiatives for the borough.
Web-services are now being developed for Hackney Circle to be able to share its data set with the council's existing Find Support Services and Better Conversations products. 
The return on investment into the digital transformation of niche and hyperlocal community services will be fascinating to calculate in due course.

Recognising and supporting the role of these signposting organisations, and providing them with the right tools to represent their communities effectively and share information, 
marks a distinct point in the evolution of Information, Advice and Support Systems (IASS). Digital investment into strategically important local organisations to deliver dynamic,
signposting offers tremendous savings in digitally transforming the delivery of frontline services.

A major step in the transition to more intelligent and affordable ways in which to identify and connect those that are most in need with the most appropriate forms of support.
