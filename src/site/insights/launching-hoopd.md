> Hoop’d is our platform for delivering digital transformation in local area engagement, communication and service provision.

During the pandemic it became increasingly clear that alternative methods of communicating and sharing information were desperately needed. Despite the myriad of different ways in which we can all communicate with one another, our residents, citizens and communities are becoming increasingly divided, increasingly difficult to identify appropriately, and harder to engage positively in communication. 

To attract new customers ever more sophisticated and powerful algorithms and digital products are finding ways to deliver content that is personalised and designed to be as aesthetically pleasing, accessible, convenient and easy to locate and operate as possible. 

Whether that means watching a movie, ordering our groceries, taking a cab, or just maintaining our attention on social media. 

The space needed to convey and receive a meaningful message, an opportunity or an update, has become incredibly crowded. At the same time our behaviour is being constantly manipulated, nudged and evolved. 

This means many traditional methods of communication are quickly becoming outdated, newsletters for example concerning a broad range of topics are no longer an appropriate format for engagement; any peice of information that is irrelevant or innappropriate to an individual is now a long-term, potentially permanent, barrier to successful engagement. 

Which means the barriers to engagement are increasing every day. 

> “The art of conversation is the art of hearing as well as of being heard.”

The workload for anyone managing and growing a community has become compromised in two ways. 

- Firstly it is difficult to create and design personalised touchpoints and tailored correspondence for every community member.

- Secondly it is difficult to promote or signpost different types of offers, opportunities and messages to each community member. 

The first problem is a problem of data quality and relevance. 
The second is a problem of data acquisition and organisation, but also user consent and data compliance.

Both are solved by digitalising and automating specific operations, but what interests us at Mortar is the huge range of different social, organisational and operational problems this leads us to creating solutions for. Solutions that range from mapping, identifying and improving service provision, to monitoring accessibility and mobility, to creating innovative new hyperlocal projects around financial and digital inclusion. 

Hoop’d is a platform we have designed that uses Mortars framework to aggregate and disseminate local area information and engagement opportunities. 

This allows us to build exciting real-time, dynamic, geo-spatial solutions that can be tailored and personalised; helping communities to deliver information to their users more effectively. At the moment we’re developing our use-cases with local authorities, housing providers and master developers, using data and technology to deliver information more equitably and utilising data to build more effective and efficient forms of service provision. 

Helping find new ways in which to deliver the right information, to the right people at the right time.
