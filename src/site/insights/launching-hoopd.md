> Happy to announce the launch of Hoopâ€™d! 

Hoopâ€™d is our platform for delivering digital transformation in local area engagement, communication and service provision.

Hoopâ€™d aggregates and disseminates local area information and engagement opportunities. 

Weâ€™re building real-time, dynamic, geo-spatial resources that can be tailored and personalised; helping communities to deliver information more effectively.

At the moment weâ€™re developing our use-cases with local authorities, housing providers and master developers; enhancing digital inclusion and improving accessibility through more equitable information and service provision. 

Next in the pipeline will be funding for an accessibility and support needs module and API, to enable better data sharing between housing and health stakeholders; for the promotion of social prescribing and financial inclusion tools. 

But in the meantime hereâ€™s to more digital inclusion and connectivity for our local communities. 

Cheers ðŸ¥‚
