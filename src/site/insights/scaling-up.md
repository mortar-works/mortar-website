It feels timely for me to write a little update. Not just to embolden and promote myself with self-congratulatory, start-up rhetoric. Though of course, this feels wonderful. Rather, to recognise some of the contributions that other individuals have made recently.

It is well documented how brutal the process of establishing a company can be. So I am incredibly proud, and equally relieved, to be embarking on this process with two exceptional co-founders; [Mehmet Duran](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mehmetduran/) and [Alper Turktas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alperturktas/). Aligned with our vision of a more efficient and effective financial sector, Mortar now boasts the technical expertise and experience necessary to deliver positive change for our clients and their customers across the real estate spectrum.

A big thank you to [Oliver Daniel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/oabdaniel/) and [Stephen Meager](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stephen-meager-57600768/) from [PwC's Scale-Up programme](https://www.pwc.co.uk/ux23/products-and-services/pwc-scale-up-programmes.html), as well as to those in the PwC community that contributed to an enormously beneficial and demanding programme.

I don't think I've ever felt as exposed as when desperately attempting and tragically failing to respond to David Maloney's consistent, repeated retorts of 'So what?'. I ask this question of myself and our products now on an almost daily basis. 'So what?', repeated, is a wonderfully cruel way in which to break the confidence of any wannabe tech founder trying to sell a vision before having a good product. Please be gentle if you put such questioning to use.

David's remarkable workshop on Market Positioning was matched by [Paul Fifield](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulfifield75/)'s passion in delivering his own Sales and Marketing masterclass. Whilst chastising me for not knowing what an SDR\* was, Paul would have done well to tear off his shirt like The Hulk to reveal the tattoo '[PREDICTABLE REVENUE](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Predictable-Revenue-Business-Practices-Salesforce-com/dp/0984380213)!' emblazoned across his chest. This didn't happen of course, but I did deserve to be chastised. I should have known. Such a tattoo would definitely stand as a pretty fair representation of the level of commitment to sales and marketing on demonstration, and should definitely be considered by Paul's [Sales Impact Academy](https://www.salesimpactacademy.co.uk/) as a potential lead generation strategy.

Being in the company of experienced founders created a safe yet highly professional environment in which to challenge and test ourselves. At such a crucial stage in the development of Mortar we have entered into the new year galvanised as a team and well prepared for the demands that growing our company will bring. As we concentrate on collaborating with our new clients our focus remains firmly on making sure we build for them what it is they actually need and require. Flashy tech and impassioned visions do not a product build.

I would like to thank [Harry Briggs](https://www.linkedin.com/in/harry-briggs-a9432561/), [Phil Guest](https://www.linkedin.com/in/philipguest/) from [Revcelerate](https://www.revcelerate.com/), Anna Caryk and [Anne Blackie](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anneblackie/) for their patience and support with my pitching and presentations; and [Gareth Lewis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/garethlewis74/), [Beth Evans](https://www.linkedin.com/in/beth-evans-6ab3037/) and [Craig Hughes](https://www.linkedin.com/in/craig-hughes-9786ab9/) for their insights into the real estate sector.
