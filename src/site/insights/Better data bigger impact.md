> I never guess. It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts.
— Arthur Conan Doyle (Sherlock Holmes)

About 70% of all data goes unutilised; and a recent poll by Oracle suggests that 95% of people say they’re overwhelmed by the amount of data and information available to them. 

An astonishing volume of data is being produced today. 

This makes it increasingly difficult to effectively collect and structure data as it is being created and captured; let alone analyse it effectively to understand how it can be best applied. Delivering a successful service or product today is therefore increasingly reliant on applying data intelligence and data integration solutions. More than ever we need access to the right information to make our decisions and to ensure the experiences and interactions for our employees and customers are productive and beneficial. 

Different approaches to pursue better results
-------------
With only a fraction of the data potentially available being collected and acted upon there still exists so many alternative ways in which new information can shape the way our services and products are being designed and delivered, or our decisions influenced and made. 

One of the reasons we have ended up with so much bias and asymettry in the systems we use today is because the same bits of information have always been studied and collected, fulfilling the same metrics and scoring, delivering the same outcomes and fulfilling the same processes, all at the expense of larger more holistic approaches to understanding systems and interelations, risks and triggers. Better systems can now be designed, and better services delivered as a result. 

Dynamic data environments
-------------
Mortar applies machine learning to create new, dynamic data environments. We have built improved methods of capturing and organising information, creating more functional directories for analysing and querying data, making it more practical and more understandable. Our products and tools benefit from these environments, making it easier and more affordable to apply intelligent data practices than ever before.  

Everyone can benefit from more efficient and effective methods for working with and applying data. But everyone needs more support in asking the right questions and developing the right approach to begin improving, adapting and responding to the data they work with. 

> The question is, is it worth doing that? Is it worth keeping that data and for how long? You can’t just store your data forever. It’s not free to do, and it’s a compounding problem.
— Dave McCrory
