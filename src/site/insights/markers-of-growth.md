"Education can be understood as growth and, furthermore, growth is the marker of a truly educational experience."

I had been lining up a post about Mortar's acceptance onto the London & Partners business growth programme for a little while. As ever I was struggling with striking the right tone between honest, self-congratulatory achievement and apostolic techno-babble eulogising. Then COVID-19 began making the news, and soon after the headlines; it is difficult to offer any kind of quirky corporate summation in the shadow it now casts.

I've seen the Warren Buffet quotation used in social commentary a few times now. Perhaps you've heard it, “It’s only when the tide goes out that you learn who has been swimming naked...” Past market corrections have helped to highlight the dangers of financial over-extension, laying bare the over-eager capital exploits of the foolish, ignorant and greedy. This is, however, not a correction in the markets. I honestly don't believe people are ready for what we are going to witness when the tide begins to expose the damage that is currently taking place. What I am reading and listening to is dismaying, to say the very least. This concerns a heart wrenching number of fatalities to expect as well as catastrophically detrimental long-term economic and social repercussions.

In the spirit of growth, that we all as a community work towards to create and achieve, I have compiled a short set of links to papers, threads, visualisations, and a podcast that I have found useful in gaining a better understanding of the current situation. I hope that these provide some benefit and that people feel able to contribute to the commentary that will be necessary to support one another on the long road that lies ahead.
