> Greater collaboration between the technology and property industries is essential for proptech to add value across the property lifecycle.

Reposting this article from the RICS Property Journal. It is already a year old, but it seems like the conversations have really only just begun.

This time last year we had all been plunged into uncertainty. It is remarkable how much has changed, but there is still a tremendous need for more collaboration and co-creation across the sector.

Our work has grown and evolved in maturity, as we have learnt how to support commercial and residential real estate providers and operators more effectively.

There is still so much to do.

Clearer lines of communication are still needed.

More dynamic and more accurate methods of sharing and accessing information is still required.
Occupiers and tenants still need more access to digital tools to interpret and engage more meaningfully with their rent accounts, service charge and estate information.
Our product Balance is capable of transforming the relationship between property stakeholders, between owners and occupiers. However we have learnt that creating small, incremental successes in how teams work, and how technology can be applied, is capable of creating massively significant results for all parties.

Property is right at the start of its entrance into a digital transformational marathon.

It is in the warm-up pen, doing a few stretches, not really sure or convinced yet this is a good idea.

But very soon we'll start seeing the massive, societal benefits that being in the race brings. Then soon we'll all be hooked. Happier and healthier. Wondering how on earth things used to work back then...
