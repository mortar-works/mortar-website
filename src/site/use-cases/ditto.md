Digital Triage Tools
The next generation of digital services
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Navigating large amounts of information has become daunting and time consuming, with huge amounts of information becoming increasingly inaccessible.   

Ditto makes it easier for people to find the information they want and need more quickly. This boosts engagement and referrals, but it also saves tremendous amounts of time for front line staff, businesses and companies. It also uses the process of triaging users to create rich, new datasets and insights associated with the needs and behaviours of targeted user groups.

How does Ditto work
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ditto enables the creation of a customised triage environment allowing organisations to identify and assess their users needs in relation to their own specific services and resources. 

The triage environment operates alongside a dynamic directory, with tailored information and service cards to deliver more effective and efficient user journeys and experiences; all made possible by Mortar's framework, providing bespoke algorithms and APIs that ensure users are being provided with the most appropriate information.

What type of products does Ditto support
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ditto is being used to deliver the Local Government Association's Digital Inclusion Directory, trialled with the London Borough of Havering and soon to enter into its Beta phase of delivery. It is being used to provide accreditation services for cultural organisations for the Greater London Authority, and to support education professionals in Cheshire and Gloucestershire assess the needs of young people at risk of exclusion. 

Why is Ditto needed
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The digitalisation of many services has led to increasingly poor user experience. Many systems just weren't designed to hold so much information and traditional websites and directories do not offer effective methods for finding and displaying different types of information, or catering for different types of users. As a result many services have grown to become less accessible, and the information held in them has become out of date, inaccurate, or simply inappropriate. Confidence for users in using such systems is low and engagement levels fall, making the work of staff difficult and in many cases impossible. 

Building better designed information, and systems for how it is accessed is essential for services grow. It is also essential for developing methods to capture the user data needed for such services to improve in their quality and efficiency.
