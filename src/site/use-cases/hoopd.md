Information is difficult to manage and is becoming increasingly difficult for people to engage with. It is time-consuming for businesses to organise and promote services, activities and engagement opportunities. It is even more difficult to keep shared systems and directories accurate and up to date. 

This ends up creating tremendous bias and asymettry in how information is being designed and distributed. People are not being reached with the right information, especially new users or those that are traditionally hard to reach or at risk of exclusion.

These are serious problems, experienced daily by frontline staff across a wide range of organisations and businesses. Problems that stop people from receiving the care and support they require, that restrict access to financial services and opportunities, and that stop people from engaging and participating in their local communities. 

Making information more dynamic and accessible

Hoop'd transforms large amounts of complex information, improving accessibility and enhancing the provision of specific services.

Whether for individual businesses or for large-scale partnerships Hoop'd delivers more tailored environments for sharing information and tools for creating more accessible and equitable methods of communication. 

Tailored environments to deliver your services more effectively
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hoop'd is an information and engagement platform, but we can tailor how it captures and presents information. This allows Hoop'd to capture and create new data sets, responding to your specific community or local area to provide you with a better, more informed, bespoke service. Some of our current projects include:

- Delivering the Mayor of London's Dementia Friendly Venues Charter
- Running Hackney's information and membership service for older residents
- Designing the Cultural Referral Platform with public health and Queen Mary University 
- Building Cheshire and Gloucestershire's directory for supporting young people at risk of exclusion
- Delivering activity timetables and engagement information for Holloway Neighbourhood Group and Clarion Housing
