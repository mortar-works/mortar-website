Despite the technology we have available today providing people with the right information and services at the right time remains a serious challenge. 

Information has become difficult to manage, time-consuming to organise and creates tremendous bias and asymettry in how it is designed and distributed. As a result it is difficult to know if services are reaching the right people, and it is becoming increasingly difficult to reach and engage with new users, especially those that are traditionally hard to reach or at risk of exclusion.

Tackling the problem
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These are serious problems that are being experienced daily by frontline staff across a wide range of organisations and businesses. These are problems that stop people from receiving the care and support they require, that restrict access to financial services and opportunities, and that stop people from engaging and participating in their local communities. 

Hoop'd tackles these problems by making it easier to apply new technology, transforming systems of information, advice and support.

- Inaccurate and overly complex directories become dynamic and intelligent resources for driving the provision of niche and hyperlocal services and products. 
- Customised and bespoke interfaces focus on enhancing user experience improving digital triage and referal systems; 
- Web-services enable organisations to collaborate with confidence that people are being engaged with the most accurate information in the most accessible and relevant format.

Designing new methods of communication 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A new system was required for two reasons: 
1. to reduce the administrative burden in managing and onboarding users, and 
2. to reduce the workload in obtaining and disseminating appropriate communication of participation events and engagement opportunities to the membership. 

Covid-19 had accelerated the significance in providing additional support in the communication of local health and wellbeing initiatives and a more integrated approach to signposting opportunities for older residents was identified as a strategic priority.

A platform for information and local area collaboration

Through a period of consultancy and co-creation with council members and users our platform Hoop’d was implemented to streamline these processes through digitalisation and automation. Hoop’d community management tools are now enabling community managers to update, organise and share information more efficiently with members, community partners and across the borough’s cultural network.  

As a result the platform is now coordinating the acquisition and sharing of information from a growing network of CVS and cultural organisations and local businesses. Further integrations are being designed to share information and resources with the borough’s Arts and Health Network, its Finding Support Services platform, and between more localised community networks to aid the coordination of more targeted engagement and participation campaigns. 

Combatting bias and asymmetry in systems of information and opportunity

The bespoke implementation of Hoop’d in Hackney is also enabling the development of features and functionalities specific to supporting communication with older residents. 

This includes a focus on accessibility, and the provision of more equitable information, services and social opportunities for residents. The ability for community managers and users to specify their communication preferences, their support needs, and to personalise the filtering of content is driving the development of more tailored opportunities, campaigns and methods of information distribution.

As our partnership with Hackney Council evolves our geospatial mapping of participation and engagement opportunities lends itself to a more informed analysis of service provision, and increased potential for enhancing service provision and supporting local housing and health partners.
