Wasted resources and staff member frustrations are common within a company's income generation and collections team. The average income officer is spending the majority of their time battling with **inaccurate information**, pursuing and **waiting for acknowledgments** and **ineffectively monitoring** accounts and schedules. 

Mortar however offers **a single source of unified financial information**, enabling our AI engine to start powering your teams with automated, predictive and proactive **account management** and **collection tools**.

Creating Positive Cultures of Forbearance
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A company's **culture of forbearance**, how it recognises and responds to invoices and arrears, will often undermine and create conflict with the customer relationship. For many companies the starting point for customer engagement is too often in response to either a problem or a debt. This reactive relationship is not a good place from which to achieve positive results. Being on the backfoot generates an enormous excess workload for the income and collections team and restricts the development of customer relationships. Cases that need resolving can easily build up, and customers are either waiting for their problems to be dealt with, or are yet to be informed that they have outstanding owings. Everyone in the pipeline ends up in **compromised and negative positions**.

Mortar's systems are based around an **advanced knowledge and understanding of forbearance**, our AI engine monitors customer engagement strategies, detecting successful methods and patterns of behaviour, helping your teams to replicate and improve sequences of success. At Mortar we focus on establishing bespoke services and sequencing to help **drive your key performance indicators (KPIs)**. We also provide access to a new suite of analytics and tooling to help you drive new KPIs, such as **mean time to arrears acknowledgement (MTTAA)** and **mean time to arrears resolution (MTTAR)**.

A New Generation of User Engagement and Success
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mortar is committed to the advance of consistent, proactive customer engagement and user-led tools for financial and account management.

In corporate service provision we are used to hearing how our outliers and edge customers consume operational resources, time and energy. As a result service quality and frequency of engagement drops for all customers. Digital investment, the implemention of **automation and machine learning**, is crucial to ensuring workloads are manageable, and enables the **transition to more consumer-led methods of acknowledgement and resolution**. Environments in which we can utilise technology to learn from our most compromising events and users, so they can be more quickly and succesfully identified, supported and resolved in the future.

The application of machine learning and automation is essential to begin communicating more effectively with customers. It is also the basis on which to start effectively sharing information, creating user-led feedback to enhance service provision and drive success. Mortar's AI engine powers this transition, providing the intelligent caseworker interfaces for analysing income, introducing predictive and behavioural tools, and highlighting the opportunities for **targeted consumer engagement**.
