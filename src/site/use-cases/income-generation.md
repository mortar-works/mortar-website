Build revenue more efficiently with AI enhanced services. Unify your finance team to pursue shared goals and monitor customer engagement.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

At Mortar we have analysed hundreds of financial systems. From the CFO down, throughout the organisation, time prioritisation represents the greatest barrier to strategic decision making and the actions that drive corporate value and revenue. 

> CFOs around the world are increasingly stretched as operational responsibilities take up an increasing amount of time that should be spent on strategic priorities. 67% of CFOs cannot focus on strategic priorities because of increasing operational responsibilities and time spent on compliance, controls and costs.   - EY, The DNA of the CFO

Wasted resources, and staff member frustrations, are no better represented than in a company's income generation and collections team. The average income officer involved in income generation is spending the majority of their time battling with **inaccurate information**, pursuing and **waiting for acknowledgments** and **ineffectively monitoring** accounts and schedules. Mortar creates a single source of unified financial information that allows our AI engine to start powering your teams with automated, predictive and proactive account management and collection methods.

Creating Positive Cultures of Forbearance

The way in which arrears are recognised and responded to represents a company's entire approach and attitude to forbearance. In many cases this **culture of forbearance** undermines or enters into conflict with the customer relationship. The starting point for customer engagement is often in response to either a problem or a debt. We are waiting for problems to arise and for our customers to become debtors, putting the finance team in **compromised and negative positions**. Not the best place from which to achieve positive results.  

Whilst restricting the development of customer relationships, being on the backfoot also generates an enormous excess workload for the income and collections team. Mortar's systems are therefore based around an **advanced knowledge and understanding of forbearance**, using digital customer engagement strategies to monitor successful methods and patterns of behaviour, helping your teams to replicate and improve sequences of success. At Mortar we focus on establishing bespoke services and sequencing to help **drive your key performance indicators (KPIs)**. We also provide access to a new suite of analytics and tooling to help you drive new KPIs, such as **mean time to arrears acknowledgement (MTTAA)** and **mean time to arrears resolution (MTTAR)**.

A New Generation of User Engagement and Success
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mortar is committed to the advance of consistent, proactive customer engagement and user-led tools for financial and account management. 

In corporate service provision we are used to hearing how our outliers and edge customers consume operational resources, time and energy. As a result service quality and frequency of engagement drops for all customers. Digital investment, the implemention of **automation and machine learning**, is crucial to ensuring workloads are manageable, and enables the **transition to more consumer-led methods of acknowledgement and resolution**. Environments in which we can utilise technology to learn from our most compromising events and users, so they can be more quickly and succesfully identified, supported and resolved in the future.

The application of machine learning and automation is essential to begin communicating more effectively with customers. It is also the basis on which to start effectively sharing information, creating user-led feedback to enhance service provision and drive success. Mortar's AI engine powers this transition, providing the intelligent caseworker interfaces for analysing income, introducing predictive and behavioural tools, and highlighting the opportunities for **targeted consumer engagement**.
