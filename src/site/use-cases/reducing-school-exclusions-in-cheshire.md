The Directory of What Works is a tool for schools and local authorities to promote better pathways for young people into local area services. The tool combines the use of data with local knowledge and lived experience, and works towards standardising data-sharing practices to create better referral and signposting opportunities.

An early engagement service
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The impact of a school exclusion is enormous. The increasing rates of exclusion and the inequality associated with exclusion rates amongst certain groups of young people is a national problem. Local areas need flexible support in the design and delivery of an effective evidence-led response. 

Our tool presents a tailored triage module, for helping teachers assess the needs of a young person, allowing them to specify what types of alternative support might be of interest or preferred. The tool then creates a recommended selection of accredited local area services and organisations, making the process of sharing information with young people, families and carers more personalised, quicker and easier.

Reach out for support
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
School exclusion is one of many broad social issues in which the defined problem is a symptom of complex issues people face in our highly fragmented systems. Early support in recommending potential services and alternative opportunities is therefore essential. 

If you work in these complex fields, battling with fragmented systems, and you want to standardise your practices of user assessment, signposting and referrral, the please do get in touch. We can deliver a tailored implementation of our Triage Tool and Hoop'd framework, creating a single service or point of contact for your users. We want to find the scalable solution that saves you time and money in the deployment of your new service, your application of data and intelligence, and the improvement of your users' experience and outcomes. 

Whatever stage you are at in either delivery or planning, we can support you in delivering the right service for you and your users and look forward to hearing from you.
