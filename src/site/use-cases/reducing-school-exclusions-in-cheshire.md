The Directory of What Works is a tool for schools and local authorities to promote better pathways for young people into local area services. The tool combines the use of data with local knowledge and lived experience, and works towards standardising data-sharing practices to create better referral and signposting opportunities.

An early engagement service
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The impact of a school exclusion is enormous. The increasing rates of exclusion and the inequality associated with exclusion rates amongst certain groups of young people is a national problem. Local areas need flexible support in the design and delivery of an effective evidence-led response. 

School exclusion is often badged as an educational issue, but it is broader than that and is often not ‘the problem’ in and of itself, but rather a symptom of complex issues that a young person is facing in a highly fragmented system. Early support in recommending potential services and alternative opportunities for young people displaying signs of distress and disruption is therefore essential. 

Our tool presents a tailored triage module, for helping teachers assess the needs of a young person, allowing them to specify what types of alternative support might be of interest or preferred. The tool then creates a recommended selection of accredited local area services and organisations, making the process of sharing information with young people, families and carers more personalised, quicker and easier.
