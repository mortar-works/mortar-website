Countless opportunities now exist to expand learning opportunities by developing more successful and impactful methods of engagement that enhance flexibility and accessibility, and transfer the learning experience into a more interactive, personalized, and collaborative process. 

Learning, assessment and accreditation
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our design and delivery of the platform for the Dementia Friendly Venues Charter is a great example of how creating successful user journeys incorporates different aspects of learning, assessment and accreditation. 

Working with the Mayor of London and the culture team at the Greater London Authority this has involved the digitalisation of a set of different processes to ensure that every user can easily access and navigate the different requirements involved in becoming a dementia friendly venue.

The result is an environment in which every user can build their understanding, and the capacity of their organisation, to implement the necessary training and services in order to achieve accreditation. 

Management, automation and building organisational capacity 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Essential in the production of such learning environments is ensuring that engagement touchpoints are clear and easily manageable, reducing administration and workload as significantly as possible. 

Designing for the end-user, for their specific journey in accessing, establishing and fulfilling their own accreditation, means designing a seamless end-to-end journey with as few requirements as possible in a governance, approval and security

Empowering end-users, public outcomes and improving access
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The translation of internal training and accreditation processes is amplified with the creation of publicly beneficial outcomes (employability, skills and training, accessibility information and public listings). 

Our environments ensure that these different information formats, informing different users and beneficiaries, are automatically generated. 

For the Dementia Friendly Venues Charter this involves the automatic creation of certification for public display, presentation on the public map of accredited venues, and a greater public awareness for those with dementia and their carers about accessible venues.
