Balance introduces a new generation of digital financial inclusion tools in the field of collections and income generation. Balance enables people to change and adapt their payment schedules, establishing unique touchpoints to improve and streamline collections whilst overcoming both short and long-term incidences of debt and arrears; ensuring that people are more effectively engaged in the process of collections.

Introducing user-led collections and flexible payments
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New methods of digitalising and automating the collections process is essential if we are to alleviate the pressure and workloads on staff and employees involved in income generation and collections. 3.8m households in the UK are in arrears for their household bills, including rent; arrears that total approximately £5.2bn. These numbers are set to increase as households face the highest increase in the cost of living in the last three decades with soaring energy prices and inflation. 

Balance is designed to be easy and simple to implement alongside existing escalation and accounts receivable (AR) services and software. Balance brings intelligence, specialised design, and systems of automation to the housing and real estate sector, enriching and enhancing the roles of income officers, collections teams and companies of all scales.
