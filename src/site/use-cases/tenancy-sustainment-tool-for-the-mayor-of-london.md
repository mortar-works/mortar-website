Working with the Mayor of London's Challenge London team we have developed the Tenancy Sustainment Tool, aimed at reducing the vulnerability of those at risk of losing their home. Evictions and homelessness continues to increase and inequalities around access to information and opportunities is growing for residents in both the public and private housing sector. 

Our tenancy sustainment tool, developed alongside Advice for Renters, presents solutions for improving early stage interventions and more preventative forms of engagement. The tool offers improved methods for delivering vital information in more accessible formats and at the same time gives landlords and housing managers an improved case management solutions at the point of first contact, driving more effective referral pathways and signposting solutions.

Accessible and up-to-date information 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Being able to provide information in the appropriate language, in accessible formats, and relevant to the residents situation and needs is tremendously challenging. The regulatory and legislative environment is changing constantly, new services and opportunities receive funding at different times, and the situations of residents can change suddenly and dramatically. Our Global API provides an accurate set of housing related resources across seven different domains of support tailored to offer information and guidance to both residents and officers in the format they need. 

For priority cases our triage and assessment forms can be conducted by the tenant or through assisted capture on the phone or in person to establish a case at the point of first contact, automatically assessing needs during the process to deliver more effective recommendations, actions and decisions. As we continue building the tool with our partners from commmunity services, housing and local government we are developing the integrations and data portability necessary to deliver quicker, more effective and impactful referrals.

Overcoming local digital inclusion challenges and barriers
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The challenges involved in connecting people, especially across large, rural geographic areas, are not going be solved quickly or easily. These challenges need dedicated programmes, local area collaborations and a coordinated distribution and monitoring of resources. 

Our Digital Inclusion Triage Tool responds to these challenges by: 
- promoting your local area digital inclusion programme
- providing the tools to bring together your stakeholders and service providers
- monitoring signpostings and referrals to your service offer
- creates the datasets to make more informed digital inclusion decisions

If you are at a point where you need advice or support with developing a local digital inclusion programme, and need tools to help engage your stakeholders and reach your target users, please get in touch. Whatever stage you are at in either delivery or planning, we can support you in designing and delivering the right service and tool for you and your users and look forward to hearing from you.
