Working with the Mayor of London's Challenge London team we have developed the Tenancy Sustainment Tool, aimed at reducing the vulnerability of those at risk of losing their home. Evictions and homelessness continues to increase and inequalities around access to information and opportunities is growing for residents in both the public and private housing sector. 

Our tenancy sustainment tool, developed alongside Advice for Renters, presents solutions for improving early stage interventions and more preventative forms of engagement. The tool offers improved methods for delivering vital information in more accessible formats and at the same time gives landlords and housing managers an improved case management solutions at the point of first contact, driving more effective referral pathways and signposting solutions.

Accessible and up-to-date information 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Being able to provide information in the appropriate language, in accessible formats, and relevant to the residents situation and needs is tremendously challenging. The regulatory and legislative environment is changing constantly, new services and opportunities receive funding at different times, and the situations of residents can change suddenly and dramatically. Our **Global API** provides an accurate set of housing related resources through access to HARS (Housing Advice and Resources Service) offering information and guidance to both residents and officers across seven different domains of support. 

Case management from the point of first contact
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For priority cases our **triage and assessment forms** can be conducted by the tenant or through assisted capture on the phone or in person to establish a case and begin conducting more effective case management right from the point of first contact, automatically assessing needs during the process to deliver more effective recommendations, actions and decisions. As we continue building the tool with our partners from commmunity services, housing and local government we are developing the **integrations and data portability** necessary to deliver quicker, more effective and impactful referrals.

Early intervention and building better human relationships
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Although the advance of new technologies is exciting and offers many opportunities to help both residents and officers, these relationships are built on **trust and a consistent quality of engagement**. As interfaces change, and the ways in which we interact with one another evolve, we need to become more ambitious and creative with how we combat digital exclusion and respond to the needs of those most excluded, at risk and vulnerable. 

If you are interested in how our Tenancy Sustainment Tool works to support the **digital transformation of housing services**, whilst putting human relationships at the heart of our design principles and outcomes, please do get in touch. We are designing new systems with our partners that offer more holistic forms of continuous engagement, monitoring and referral, especially at the most difficult and stressful moments.
