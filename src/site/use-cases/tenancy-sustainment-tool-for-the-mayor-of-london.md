The impact and cost of losing a home continues to increase and inequalities around access to information and opportunities make the problem incredibly challenging to address. There is an overwhelming change in attitude however towards working more closely with tenants and families to overcome these challenges and create more sustainability, ambition and opportunity to for the future. 

Early and accessible engagement is at the heart of these approaches, and our tenancy sustainment tool offers flexibility in how more households at risk of losing their home can make contact and receive support.

Making engagement an accessible experience
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The tool creates an accessible environment for capturing data and onboarding users in multiple languages and formats, simultaneously supporting the triaging of users and their onboarding into a tailored case management system. Applying our user-led design principles the tool generates recommended actions for both the user and the officers supporting their case, whilst our algorithms help to prioritise resources and actions so the best decisions are made for the user and their situation. 

Access to the right information at the right time is crucial in pressurised and stressful situations. Through a better management of communication preferences and recommended referral pathways the tool generates a range of new touchpoints for engagement, combining financial and digital inclusion resources to support engagement and signposting, as well as the data sharing technology required to improve the process and experience of referral.

Overcoming local digital inclusion challenges and barriers
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The challenges involved in connecting people, especially across large, rural geographic areas, are not going be solved quickly or easily. These challenges need dedicated programmes, local area collaborations and a coordinated distribution and monitoring of resources. 

Our Digital Inclusion Triage Tool responds to these challenges by: 
- promoting your local area digital inclusion programme
- providing the tools to bring together your stakeholders and service providers
- monitoring signpostings and referrals to your service offer
- creates the datasets to make more informed digital inclusion decisions

If you are at a point where you need advice or support with developing a local digital inclusion programme, and need tools to help engage your stakeholders and reach your target users, please get in touch. Whatever stage you are at in either delivery or planning, we can support you in designing and delivering the right service and tool for you and your users and look forward to hearing from you.
