Leading digital inclusion partnerships
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Salford City Council are the lead partner in the development and implementation of our Digital Inclusion Triage Tool. A Local Government Association backed product for creating customised digital inclusion programmes and networks. The tool offers a custom environment for assessing the needs of users and signposting them to recommended pathways and services for support. 

Why does Salford City Council need support?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The pandemic caused a seismic shift in highlighting the nationâ€™s need for access to three main verticals - digital kit, digital connectivity and digital skills. In Salford, a clear target operating model was created, to harness opportunities and deliver a new phase of the city's digital inclusion journey. 

Salford achieved tremendous results in forging a 'social movement' around digital inclusion, establishing a Digital Providers Network consisting of 79 local organisations, all delivering different resources in response to the city's three main verticals. What was needed however was a way in which to address key design principles essential to combatting the barriers that over 10% of Salford residents were experiencing in relation to their digital inclusion such as poverty, unemployment, and homelessness:

1. the creation of new pathways and partnerships and enhancing human interaction and strengthening relationships
2. and to maximise the potential of their systems and networks using data and intelligence to ensure the right intervention is delivered at the right time

Customised and scalable local area directories
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

An example of a scalable solution utilising this framework is our Digital Inclusion Triage Tool developed in collaboration with the LGA. The triage tool utilises our **global API system** to provide different local areas across the UK with an accredited directory of national digital inclusion resources. The tool also fosters a local digital inclusion network as well as ensures their users have access to relevant resources and interventions. 

Similar collaborations with the Mayor of London and the GLA have resulted in our **Tenancy Sustainment Tool** and our **Triage and Referral Tool**, addressing the diverse needs of users at different local service levels, always customised to compliment and evolve the quality of the existing 'front-door' for users. 

The Future of engagement and the transformation of user interfaces
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As we continue to expand and refine the Hoop'd framework we are continually enhancing our ability to assess your user needs, integrate with internal systems and requirements, and establish the environments necessary to support your teams. Through our **Service Design Packages** we tailor the Hoop'd framework to connect siloed service departments and apply data and business intelligence for the long-term benefit of your organisation.

With dynamic information environments you can transform your directories to deliver more powerful, **personalized relationships** with your users, responding to their specific **support and access needs**. We want all services to go beyond addressing specific siloed needs, to target more seamless collaborations between team members, local networks and all service users. Creating a more **holistic, consistent and supportive service experience**.
