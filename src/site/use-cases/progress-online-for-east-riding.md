Progress Online is a tailored implementation of our Digital Inclusion Triage Tool for East Riding, developed in partnership with the Humber and Yorkshire Integrated Care Board. For East Riding the tool is establishing a new Digital Inclusion Network, working to engage residents in early interventions across a huge, rural, geographic area.

Tailored preventative and early engagement services
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In Humber and Yorkshire there is tremendous inequality in access to information, services and opportunities. In East Riding three of their twenty six wards are in the top 10% most deprived and, with a 93% rural area, isolation is a serious issue. Digital inclusion is therefore a massive strategic priority for ensuring people feel connected, engaged and safe.  

For East Riding the need for a tool to help begin creating these connections is essential. A digital solution was needed to identify people's needs, to match them with the services and resouces available, and where unavailable, to demonstrate the demand and represent the case for the services and resources people need.

Reach out for support
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The cost of investing in health prevention is much lower than the cost of treatment after debilitation or disease occurs. Hoop'd delivers a powerful model for creating a tailored and trusted community navigation service for local residents, with the capacity to target specific groups and excluded users with more accessible touchpoints, signposting and referral. 

If you are at a point where you need advice or support with developing a local community navigation service, and need help applying service design or technology to help reach your target users, please get in touch. Whatever type of service or local area partnership you are engaged in and whatever stage you are at in either delivery or planning, we can support you in designing and delivering the right service for you and your users. We are looking forward to hearing from you.
