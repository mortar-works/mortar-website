> “Triple the number of households are now in arrears, equivalent to a third of all low-income households.”
> **Dragged Down by Debt. Published 21st October 2021**

The movement in financial digital inclusion will continue to play an increasingly significant role in delivering debt and advice services. 

Systems that deliver more personalised and tailored flexibility for overcoming both short and long-term incidences of debt and arrears improve collections metrics, whilst establishing unique new touchpoints for supporting the financial wellbeing of customers. 

As of October 2021, 3.8m households in the UK are in arrears for their household bills, including rent; arrears that total approximately £5.2bn.

These numbers are set to increase as the UK’s furlough scheme comes to an end, removing the financial support for the employment of 11.6 million people. This is at the same time as households face the highest increase in the cost of living in the last three decades with soaring energy prices and inflation set to reach 5% in 2022.
