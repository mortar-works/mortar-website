Using our platform Hoop'd we are working with partners across the corporate and cultural sector to co-create new audience and engagement programmes, led by digital design and community collaboration. These tailored and targeted products are affordable, utilising our community management framework and tools, but can be completely white-labelled and branded for your audience or customers. With our advanced accessibility modules we are supporting projects that target inclusion for older residents and deliver educational outputs for school children. All with a system for helping stakeholders to capture local area insights, drive improvements in service provision, and establish business case for investment.

Drive productivity, expand insights and streamline reporting with advanced solutions for data sharing, acquisition and consent
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Data sharing** is absolutely integral to the process of decision making; informing operations, reporting, strategy and investment. The transfer, adaptability and organisation of data is growing in importance, whilst at the same time becoming increasingly complex, as data sets get larger and more data sources are made available.

Some of the most important sources of data, our customer, client and user data, also requires the **correct protocols** in how it is obtained and utilised. Acquiring **data consent** and making data available to all stakeholders is a delicate balance of **trust, purpose and understanding**. The way in which data is acquired and presented reflects the quality of these relationships as well as the significance of the benefits that data can offer to each party.

Building cohesive data environments; a unified source of accurate information
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mortar's AI engine simplifies the complex process of organising and interpreting large data sets. Our universal data adaptor makes it possible for varying formats and types of data to be acquired and organised into a single, unified and Cohesive Data Environment (CDE). A Mortar CDE provides the connectivity necessary for data to be obtained using web services, automatically capturing data to be **analysed in real-time**.

Mortar's AI engine uses this environment to process and compare large data sets, searching for distinct patterns and behaviours, but also searching for the outliers and anomolies that can present a broader range of **scenario and stress testing**, more **accurate forecasting** and alternative forms of **predictive analysis**.

Multiple interfaces for multiple users to share real-time data
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This movement in data acquisition is changing the way whole sectors are able to engage with their customers, stakeholders and users. Mortar enables the provision of **multiple interfaces** that have different outputs depending on the privelages of the user; presenting data in different ways so that the benefits of data acquisition can be shared with all stakeholders.

Data analysis is not just about how data is captured and interpreted. It is a method of engaging customers and stakeholders. Effective **user on-boarding** is vital to obtaining the necessary data consent from the user, and Mortar co-creates products that are advancing methods in fulfilling user **identity verification**, Know Your Customer **(KYC)** protocols, and Anti Money Laundering **(AML)** services.
