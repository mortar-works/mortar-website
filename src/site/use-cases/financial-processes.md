Financial integrity is at the heart of Mortar, it is why we are so committed to delivering AI powered interfaces for companies and businesses. Financial integrity means team members being able to access and act upon accurate, real-time information on any account, invoice or bill at any moment in time, across any part of the financial pipeline. This access is integral to being able to improve supplier, client and consumer relationships; as well as increasing employee productivity and team morale. Real-time account positions are the essential starting point for any company that is seeking to undertake successful digital transformation projects and evolve the delivery of their cloud and web based services, products and applications for their consumers and clients. 

For these reasons Mortar has made it easy and simple for treasury and finance teams to start implementing AI and benefit from real-time, accurate financial information.

Payment allocation is the first point at which automation and machine learning augments employee roles and decision making, aiding the drive towards financial integrity. Mortar's intelligent payment allocation system provides a connected set of user interfaces for treasury team members, to turn them into AI assisted decision makers, freeing up thousands of hours of time to concentrate on higher value tasks and responsibilities.

A simplified financial system 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is very common for treasury teams to be handling multiple sources of information. Team members have to refer to both billing and invoicing; accounts receivable and accounts payable; bank account data as well as customer relationship management tools; to ascertain the correct allocation of a payment.  

Mortar simplifies this complex financial system, creating a unified layer of financial information. Mortar's universal data adaptor obtains and organises information using our AI engine to establish **end-to-end billing**, **account and balance reconciliation**, and inform the process of **intelligent payment allocation**.
