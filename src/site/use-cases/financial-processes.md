Transform traditional financial processes with easy-to-use interfaces and AI assisted decision making
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Financial integrity** is at the heart of Mortar, it is why we are so committed to delivering AI powered interfaces for companies and businesses. Financial integrity means team members being able to access and act upon **accurate, real-time information** on accounts, invoices and bills at any moment in time, **across any part of the financial pipeline**. 

This access is integral to improving supplier, client and consumer relationships, as well as increasing employee productivity and team morale. Real-time account positions are the essential starting point in undertaking successful **digital transformation** projects, evolving the delivery of **cloud and web based services**, and enabling the introduction of **new products and applications** to consumers and clients. 

For these reasons Mortar has made it easy and simple for treasury and finance teams to start implementing AI, to benefit from real-time, accurate financial information.

Payment allocation is the first point at which automation and machine learning augments employee roles and decision making, aiding the drive towards financial integrity. Mortar's intelligent payment allocation system provides a connected set of user interfaces for treasury team members, to turn them into AI assisted decision makers, freeing up thousands of hours of time to concentrate on higher value tasks and responsibilities.

A simplified financial system 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is common for treasury teams to be responsible for handling and organising multiple sources of information. Team members have to refer to both billing and invoicing; accounts receivable and accounts payable; bank account data as well as customer relationship management tools; to be able to ascertain the correct allocation of a payment.  

Mortar simplifies this complex financial system, creating a unified layer of financial information and **combining data sources** into a **single user interface**. Mortar's universal data adaptor obtains and organises information using our AI engine to enable companies to establish **end-to-end billing**, **account and balance reconciliation**, and inform the process of **intelligent payment allocation**.
