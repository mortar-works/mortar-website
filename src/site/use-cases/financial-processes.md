Transform traditional financial processes with easy-to-use interfaces and AI assisted decision making
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Financial integrity is at the heart of Mortar's interest in driving the use of AI. For a company financial integrity means being able to access accurate, real-time information on any account, invoice or bill at any time or moment, across any part of the financial pipeline. This information is integral to being able to improve supplier, client and consumer relationships. As well as employee productivity and team morale. It is also essential to a company being able to undertake successful digital transformation projects and evolve the use of other cloud and web based services, products and applications.

Mortar's intelligent payment allocation system provides a connected set of user interfaces for treasury team members, to turn them into AI assisted decision makers, freeing up thousands of hours of time to concentrate on higher value tasks and responsibilities.
