> “Triple the number of households are now in arrears, equivalent to a third of all low-income households.”
> **Dragged Down by Debt. Published 21st October 2021**

As of October 2021, 3.8m households in the UK are in arrears for their household bills, including rent; arrears that total approximately £5.2bn.

These numbers are set to increase as the UK’s furlough scheme comes to an end, removing the financial support for the employment of 11.6 million people. This is at the same time as households face the highest increase in the cost of living in the last three decades with soaring energy prices and inflation set to reach 5% in 2022. 

At this time of intense and growing pressure our platform Balance brings support and assistance to income officers, collections teams and companies of all scales in:

retaining and improving customer relations and 
delivering a more efficient, digital customer-facing collections process.
