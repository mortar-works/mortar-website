  Our framework Hoop'd delivers bespoke, accessible accreditation and training environments. This platform for Alzheimers UK and the Greater London Authority makes the process of learning, training and becoming dementia friendly available to all venues across London.

In response to the ‘postcode lottery’ of support on offer for people with dementia we worked with the GLA to design the Dementia Friendly Venues Charter, supporting hundreds more venues across the capital in becoming dementia friendly and ready to welcome those with dementia, their families and carers.

Developing inclusive programmes and venues
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dementia is one of the biggest health and social care challenges facing London today. There are over 72,000 people with dementia living in London, and this number is set to more than triple within the coming decades. However, tremendous work is necessary to increase awareness of dementia and its impact, shift attitudes, tackle stigma, and convene and coordinate partners to act. 

The charter transforms cultural venues for people living with dementia and their carers through a range of dementia-friendly resources, and guides them in understanding how they can develop inclusive programmes and performances, dedicated relaxed sessions, clear signage, designated chill out zones and staff training. 

Working alongside the Alzheimer’s Society and the Museum of London the charter gives London venues the opportunity to present dementia more effectively to its staff and volunteers, training them in how their venue offers support to those with dementia and improving their overall awareness in how to work with visitors that require specific access and support needs.

Building better touchpoints and datasets
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The tool designed for the Mayor of London creates an automated process for venues to register and become dementia friendly accredited. It also provides officers at the Greater London Authority with a range of data on audience numbers, and the reach and capacity of the cultural sector to serve London's dementia community. Supporting the business case for further investment into dementia related activities and highlighting areas where there is a need for more engagement opportunities geographically as well as in terms of the diversity of the offer. 

In addition the tool provides officers with a real-time view of how venues are progressing through the accreditation process. Offering them the ability to create touchpoints with individual organisations, or groups of orgnanisations as they progress through the sections of the accreditation process. With this overview officers can dictate their workload in delivering additional training and support to venues, as well as continually be able to report effectively on the progress of the charter and initiative as a whole. 

Building tailored training and accreditation environments
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We are working on making these environments more available to support training and engagement in accessibility more available to all venues and in all geographic areas. If you are interested in bringing better training or accreditation environments to your users and networks then please do get in touch. We can tailor and customise the environment you need to create the best user experience and deliver the best outcomes for your users.
