  In response to services needing up-to-date information Mortar creates and maintains environments that enhance multi-service collaboration and the application of intelligence. Our modular framework, Hoop'd, delivers tailored webservices that acquire, capture and share information; transforming customer engagement and service efficiency.

Information access and application
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you work in service delivery you will be aware that huge amounts of time and resources are spent supporting people in finding and accessing the information they need. At the same time service and team workloads are growing, and many of those most in need of help and support are not being reached and engaged. The result is increasing levels of exclusion, growing pressure on service delivery and escalating costs.

Mortar has been working with the **Local Government Association** (LGA) and the **Greater London Authority** (GLA) to find scalable solutions to these challenges, exploring ways in which we can help address complex user needs and increase the capacity and efficiency of services and their delivery.

Our framework **Hoop’d** is one of the outcomes of this work.    

Hoop’d: a framework for intelligent services
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hoop’d is a flexible and modular framework, making it easier and more affordable for you to design accessible services by bringing together siloed departments, building local area networks and identifying users. Through customised user interfaces Hoop'd empowers more seamless navigation, self-referral, and self-assessment, enhancing the user experience of your service and helping you to create more engaging and targeted directories and campaigns.

At the core of Hoop’d is a technical infrastructure capable of providing you with the tailored **web services, algorithms, and APIs** needed to capture, organize, and act on information efficiently. This infrastructure supports your application of intelligence to improve user outcomes across a growing range of service domains, from youth services to adult social care, as well as specialised areas such as housing, financial, and digital inclusion.

Customised and scalable local area directories
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

An example of a scalable solution utilising this framework is our Digital Inclusion Triage Tool developed in collaboration with the LGA. The triage tool utilises our **global API system** to provide different local areas across the UK with an accredited directory of national digital inclusion resources. This tool can also foster a local digital inclusion network as well as ensure their users have access to relevant resources and interventions. 

Similar collaborations with the Mayor of London and the GLA have resulted in our **Tenancy Sustainment Tool** and our **Triage and Referral Tool**, addressing the diverse needs of users at different local service levels, always aligned to, complimenting and evolving the quality of the existing 'front-door' for users. 

The Future of Engagement and the transformation of user interfaces
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As we continue to refine the Hoop'd framework and expand its application we are continually enhancing our ability to assess your user needs, integrate with internal systems and requirements, and establish the environment necessary to inform your team's decisions and collaborations. Through our **Service Design Packages** we tailor the Hoop'd framework to connect siloed service departments and apply intelligence for the long-term benefit of your organisation.

With dynamic information environments you can transform services to deliver more powerful, **personalized relationships** with your users, responding to their specific **support and access needs**. The next generation of services will then be positioned to go beyond addressing your own siloed needs, to target more seamless collaborations between your team and your users to create a **holistic, consistent and supportive service experience**.
