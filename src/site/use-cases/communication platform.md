  In response to services needing dynamic, up-to-date information, Mortar creates and maintains environments that enhance community navigation and multi-service collaboration. Our modular framework, Hoop'd, delivers tailored webservices that acquire, capture and share information; transforming customer engagement and service experience.

Information access and application
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
People are struggling more than ever to find and access the information they need. At the same time services are failing to apply information and data effectively to reach and engage those in need of help and support. The result is growing pressure on service delivery, with increasing workloads and escalating costs.

Mortar has been working with the Local Government Association and the Greater London Authority to find scalable solutions to the problems associated with addressing complex user needs and increasing the capacity and efficiency of service delivery. 

Our framework Hoop’d is one of the outcomes of this work. 

We are building Hoop’d to drive the next generation of intelligent services. The way in which Hoop’d captures, manages and acts upon information and data is essential to ensuring services can build effective datasets, adopt and apply AI, and deliver on the potential of our services to transform inclusion and accessibility. 

Hoop’d: a framework for intelligent services
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hoop’d is a flexible and modular framework, easy and affordable to customise for enhancing existing services, building service networks, and identifying target users. Our Hoop’d modules offer the tailored design of more accessible user interfaces for navigating information and prioritising methods of self referral and self assessment, improving service user experience, engagement and retention.

Other user facing modules enhance service communication strategies through delivering multi-modal, non-digital forms of communication, providing information environments capable of reaching people through curated channels such as text, WhatsApp, print and socials. 

These modules enable services to combat different forms of exclusion, such as digital exclusion, as well as forming better pathways for those with literacy and language needs. Applying these user facing modules allows a service to immediately begin capturing and responding to user data, and begins the development of a better, more integrated information management system. 

Enhancing user experience and engagement

The greatest potential for increasing service capacity and efficiency is in the technical infrastructure at the heart of Hoop’d. Through its use of micro services Hoop’d delivers tailored web services, algorithms and APIs that offer a range of different methods for capturing, organizing and acting on information. 

This management of data is what enables our design of more accessible and personalised user journeys and our application of intelligence to improve user outcomes and success. The Hoop’d infrastructure is focused on creating better systems for maintaining up to date information, increasing the trust and confidence that users have in service content, recommendations and requests. Whether that be across youth services, adult social care or in more targeted forms of provision within housing, financial and digital inclusion.

In the case of our tool, Ditto, the Digital Inclusion Triage Tool, developed in partnership with the LGA, we use our global API system to provide local areas with a maintained and accredited directory of national digital inclusion resources, alongside facilitating their own digital inclusion network of service providers and maintaining their own local area directory of resources and interventions.   

With the Mayor of London and the GLA the development of these shared national resources extends into the provision of Rent Response, our Tenancy Sustainment Tool, providing information for renters at risk of losing their home; and our Triage and Referral Tool, supporting officers with addressing all the needs of users at the front-door into local area services.

Unleashing the potential of information with Hoop’d
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

With our partners and clients we have created dynamic directories and information environments across multiple use-cases; combating digital exclusion, reducing school exclusions, preventing poverty and sustaining tenancies to name a few. 

In doing so we have been able to begin exploring the effective and responsible application of intelligence. Machine learning and AI has the potential to drive the early and preventative engagement that national and local services need, with the capability of providing personalised information, advice and guidance to every user on a continuous basis. 

The Future of Engagement and the transformation of user interfaces
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As we build Mortar’s framework and expand our application of Hoop’d we are increasing our efficacy for assessing user needs, understanding complex and multiple needs, informing decisions and actions of service providers, calculating risk and promoting early and preventative forms of service intervention. Building the new ways in which intelligence can benefit the long-term affordability and efficiency of our service sector. 

With dynamic information environments, new datasets and the correct technical infrastructure, the interfaces for our services will be ready to change to adopt new more efficient and personalised behaviours, speech and gestures. The next generation of services will be able not just to respond to our citizens needs, but working alongside them to provide the early engagement and support
