  In response to services needing dynamic, up-to-date information, Mortar creates and maintains environments that enhance community navigation and multi-service collaboration. Our modular framework, Hoop'd, delivers tailored webservices that acquire, capture and share information; transforming customer engagement and service experience.

Information access and application
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
People are struggling more than ever to find and access the information they need. At the same time services are failing to apply information and data effectively to reach and engage those in need of help and support. The result is growing pressure on service delivery, with increasing workloads and escalating costs.

Mortar has been working with the Local Government Association and the Greater London Authority to find scalable solutions to the problems you are experiencing with how to address complex user needs and how to increase the capacity and efficiency of your service and its delivery.

Our framework Hoop’d is one of the outcomes of this work.    

Hoop’d: a framework for intelligent services
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hoop’d is a flexible and modular framework, making it easier and more affordable for you to design accessible services by bring together your siloed departments, build your local area networks and identify your users. Through customised user interfaces Hoop'd empowers more seamless navigation, self-referral, and self-assessment, enhancing the user experience of your service and helping you to create more engaging and targeted campaigns.

At the core of Hoop’d is a technical infrastructure capable of providing you with the tailored web services, algorithms, and APIs needed to capture, organize, and act on information efficiently. This infrastructure supports your application of intelligence to improve user outcomes across a growing range of service domains, from youth services to adult social care, as well as specialised areas such as housing, financial, and digital inclusion.

Customised and scalable tools

For example our Digital Inclusion Triage Tool developed in collaboration with the LGA, utilises our global API system to provide local areas across the UK with an accredited directory of national digital inclusion resources. This tool can foster a local digital inclusion network as well as ensure it has access to relevant resources and interventions. Similar collaborations with the Mayor of London and the GLA have resulted in our Tenancy Sustainment Tool and our Triage and Referral Tool, addressing the diverse needs of users at different local service levels, always aligned to, complimenting and evolving the quality of the existing 'front-door' for users. 

The Future of Engagement and the transformation of user interfaces
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As we continue to refine the Hoop'd framework and expand its application we are elevating our ability to work with you to assess your user needs, understand your internal systems and requirements, and establish the environment necessary to inform you and your team's decisions and collaborations. Through a Service Design Package we tailor our framework to connect siloed service departments, applying intelligence for the long-term benefit of your organisation.

In these dynamic information environments, we can support your services in their evolution into more powerful, personalized relationships, attuned to specific support and access needs. The next generation of your service will need to go beyond addressing your own siloed needs; it should be targeting a more seamless collaboration between your team members and your users to create a holistic, consistent and supportive service environment.
