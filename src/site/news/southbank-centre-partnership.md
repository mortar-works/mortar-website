<strong>Enabling NHS and Cultural Sector data sharing and service delivery</strong>

We’re delighted to announce our role as technical partner in an exciting new partnership with the Southbank Centre and the South East London Integrated Care Board. 

This groundbreaking partnership aims to improve the mental health of children and young people across south east London, offering creative opportunities and resources to tackle health inequalities by focusing on those most in need. 

Mortar will be supporting the partnership with the implementation of a bespoke environment promoting the Southbank's offer, facilitating referrals into its programmes, and ensuring information and data is shared safely and securely to enable effective delivery, monitoring and reporting on service outcomes. As a scalable platform built on our modular Hoop'd framework we'll be working with Southbank Centre and a growing number of partners to build a young person's health centre fit for future needs and demands.  

The partnership will focus on supporting the development of:

✅ The Southbank Children and Young People’s Creative Health Centre: A dedicated space for creative health programmes that improve and support the mental health and wellbeing of local children and young people.

✅ Waiting Well Interventions: Supporting children on CAMHS waiting lists through creative activities.

✅ Creative Health Prevention Programmes: Using the arts to promote better mental health and prevent issues before they arise.

Over the next 12 months, the Southbank Centre and SEL ICB will work with us to engage the NHS, cultural, voluntary and charitable sector partners to establish the long-term roadmap for delivering key programmes for local communities in South London.
