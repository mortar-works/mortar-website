The Innovation Zone is an initiative led by the LGA in partnership with PUBLIC, a leading organisation dedicated to supporting the digital transformation of the public sector. PUBLIC works to build lasting and impactful relationships between innovative technology companies and government departments, making it a key stakeholder in how the public sector can best innovate and adopt technology.

Together, PUBLIC and the LGA brought together local government leaders, technology innovators, and change-makers at the Innovation Zone. With over 80 attendees in person and more than 150 joining virtually, the event was a hub for collaboration, knowledge sharing, and forward-thinking ideas on transforming local services through technology.

As one of the selected startups, Mortar had the privilege of presenting our service design framework, Hoop’d. Our founder, George Unsworth, shared how Hoop’d is being used by local authority partners to tackle complex challenges and create more effective, user-focused public services. The session was part of an agenda that featured insights from speakers including Councillor Alex Coley, Eoin Mulgrew from 10 Downing Street, and Mavis Machirori and Anna Studman from the Ada Lovelace Institute.

Reflecting on the event, George Unsworth remarked:
> Presenting at the Innovation Zone was an incredible opportunity to showcase how Hoop’d is helping local authorities solve complex challenges. The energy in the room was a testament to the collective commitment to innovation in public services. It’s inspiring to see councils and startups come together to rethink how we deliver better outcomes for communities.

The importance of collaboration and knowledge-sharing in fostering innovation was echoed by attendees. Keri Landau, who participated in the event, shared: "Today was a great example of how important it is for councils to share and learn from one another. It's about building trust and understanding while fostering innovation. We need to understand how to innovate effectively within government frameworks."

At Mortar, we’re honored to be part of a community that is dedicated to creating more effective and inclusive public services. Events like The Innovation Zone reinforce the power of partnership between local authorities and innovative startups. We look forward to continuing to work with PUBLIC, the LGA and our partners in local government to push the boundaries of what’s possible in the public sector.
