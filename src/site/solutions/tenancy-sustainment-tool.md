Our Community Navigation Platform enables Hackney Council's culture and public health team to work together to reach and connect with older residents, in particular those living alone. Residents are engaged with tailored community and cultural sector touchpoints, and consistent information in accessible formats; all monitored and powered by our Hoop'd platform to drive more effective early interventions.

Tailored preventative and early engagement services
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hackney Circle is a specially designed service for reaching isolated older residents in the borough. It is designed around a free membership programme for older residents, supporting them in staying active, and becoming connected to the borough’s community and cultural offer.

Hackney Circle uses our community navigation platform Hoop’d to manage a network of over 40 cultural partners, promoting current participation opportunities to older residents. As part of the service, Hoop’d delivers a set of tools to make engagement easier and more accessible for older residents. This includes managing users, communications, bookings, and feedback for all associated partners
