### Why It Matters  
With growing inequalities in access to housing information, advice, and support, the Tenancy Sustainment Tool provides a much-needed solution for housing providers to deliver better tenant outcomes. By improving the accessibility of advice and support, landlords and housing officers can help tenants stay in their homes, reducing the number of evictions and promoting long-term tenancy sustainment.

The tool builds trust between tenants and landlords, offering housing managers the insights they need to intervene early and provide tailored support to tenants facing financial or housing challenges.
