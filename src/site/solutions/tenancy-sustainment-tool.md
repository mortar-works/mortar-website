## Tenancy Sustainment Tool  

Helping tenants stay safe in their homes through better support and early intervention

**Our Tenancy Sustainment Tool** is designed to assist housing managers and landlords in providing early intervention, preventing evictions, and helping tenants who are at risk of losing their homes. By delivering tailored advice, referrals, and case management in a streamlined, user-friendly platform, our tool offers real-time support to both tenants and officers, fostering stronger relationships and better outcomes for all parties involved.

### How it Works  
The Tenancy Sustainment Tool offers an all-in-one platform for delivering advice, assessing tenant needs, and creating early intervention pathways. The tool integrates with local services and housing advice systems to streamline the delivery of critical information and support for tenants at risk of eviction. 

- **User-friendly case management:** Easily manage and track tenants' progress through assessments, referrals, and support networks.
- **Integrated local directory:** Access a comprehensive list of local resources and services tailored to tenants’ needs.
- **Real-time risk monitoring:** Track tenant risk factors and receive recommendations for timely interventions.
- **Accessible information:** Ensure tenants receive the right information, in the right format, and at the right time.

### Why It Matters  
With growing inequalities in access to housing information, advice, and support, the Tenancy Sustainment Tool provides a much-needed solution for housing providers to deliver better tenant outcomes. By improving the accessibility of advice and support, landlords and housing officers can help tenants stay in their homes, reducing the number of evictions and promoting long-term tenancy sustainment.

The tool builds trust between tenants and landlords, offering housing managers the insights they need to intervene early and provide tailored support to tenants facing financial or housing challenges.
