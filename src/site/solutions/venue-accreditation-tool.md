## Introduction  
Our Venue Accreditation Tool enables cultural, commercial, and community venues to become more accessible and inclusive. Our platform supports training and resources for staff, helping you meet specific accessibility and service standards. Whether you're aiming for dementia-friendly certification, accessibility accreditation, or customer service excellence, our tool makes it easier and more efficient to achieve these goals.

Accredited venues create a welcoming environment for everyone, improve community and team engagement, and meet evolving legal requirements and public expectations.

## How it Works  
Our platform delivers an all-in-one solution for training, assessment, and progress tracking. We provide the tools you need to onboard, train, and certify your venue staff. The process is broken into clear, manageable stages, and can be fully customised to meet the needs of your organisation.

### 1. Training  
- Interactive training modules cover a variety of topics from accessibility standards to customer service best practices.
- Includes self-paced courses for staff to learn at their own convenience.

### 2. Assessment  
- Staff complete assessments to demonstrate their knowledge and understanding.
- Automatic progress tracking allows administrators to monitor certification readiness.

### 3. Accreditation  
- Once all modules and assessments are completed, your venue receives its certification.
- The tool provides a downloadable accreditation certificate and offers guidance on maintaining standards.

## Key Features  

### Custom Training Modules  
Tailor training to your venue's specific needs. Our tool offers flexibility in setting up learning paths for various service standards such as dementia-friendly services, accessibility, or general customer care. Design the resources you need and want to provide to your team members and users. 

### Progress Tracking & Reporting  
Monitor venue, staff and volunteer engagement, track progress towards accreditation, and visualise who needs additional support. Keep oversight simple with automated reporting features.

### Scaling for your Sites and Partners  
Whether you manage large multiple sites and venues with big teams, or a small community space with a small number of staff or volunteers, our platform scales to fit your needs. With easy-to-use interfaces and cloud-based accessibility, your team can engage with the tool and manage users from any number of locations.

### Accreditation and Certification  
Easily manage and display your venue's certification once the training and assessments are complete. You can update and renew certifications directly from the platform, ensuring your standards are always up to date.

### Geospatial Mapping  
Showcase your accredited venues on a dynamic, public-facing map. This helps attract visitors and customers by highlighting your commitment to inclusivity and service excellence.
