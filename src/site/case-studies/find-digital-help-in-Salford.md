Leading digital inclusion partnerships
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Salford City Council are the lead partner in the development and implementation of our Digital Inclusion Triage Tool. A Local Government Association backed product for creating customised digital inclusion programmes and networks. The tool offers a custom environment for assessing the needs of users and signposting them to recommended pathways and services for support. 

Why does Salford City Council need support?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The pandemic caused a seismic shift in highlighting the nation’s need for digital devices, digital connectivity and digital skills. In Salford, a clear target operating model achieved tremendous results in forging a 'social movement' around digital inclusion, establishing a Digital Providers Network consisting of 79 local organisations, all delivering different resources in response to the city's needs. However, what was needed was a way in which to address the **key design principles** essential to combatting the barriers that digitally excluded residents experience such as poverty, unemployment, and homelessness. These design principles include:

1. The creation of new pathways and partnerships to enhance human interaction and strengthen relationships
2. The use of data and intelligence to maximise the potential of systems and networks to deliver the right intervention at the right time

Creating and maintaining local area directories
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Digital Help Finder utilises our **global API system** to provide national, accredited resources alongside Salford's own local area directory. This combination of different types of resources alleviates pressure on the development of local area directories, offering a variety of pathways for supporting digital inclusion already present and effective before local area resources are developed. This is enabling us to support the growth and sustainability of local area directories in Salford as well as across all our associate partners. 

For managing Salford's local area directory the Hoop'd framework on which the tool is built offers a range of modules and automations to consistently **monitor and maintain the health** of the directory overall. As a webservice the tool also offers Salford access to transformative technology for sharing information and resources across departments, saving time and effort in the management of local area information. 

Monitoring the impact
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Digital Help Finder has reduced front-line service pressure and workload in supporting the 10% of Salford's population that lack the essential digital skills needed to access services. The time savings using the tool amount to over **26 hours a week** with a cost saving of over **£19k per locality**. In addition the tool is reducing **staff stress levels by 40%** and increasing **confidence in signposting and referral by 22%**.

As we continue to monitor the impact of the tool in reaching excluded residents and improving digital skills we will also assess the value of the tool's dataset and explore ways in which it can complement and enrich Salford's use of the Digital Exclusion Risk Index (DERI) to better target digital inclusion interventions and make stronger business cases for local area investment into digital devices, connectivity and digital skills.
