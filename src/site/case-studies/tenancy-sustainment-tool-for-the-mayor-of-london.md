Working with the Mayor of London's Challenge London team we have developed the Tenancy Sustainment Tool, aimed at reducing the vulnerability of those at risk of losing their home. Evictions and homelessness continues to increase and inequalities around access to information and opportunities is growing for residents in both the public and private housing sector. 

Our tenancy sustainment tool presents solutions for improving early stage interventions and more preventative forms of engagement. The tool offers improved methods for delivering vital information in more accessible formats and at the same time improves case management at the point of first contact for landlords and housing managers, creating more effective referral pathways and signposting actions.

Accessible and up-to-date information 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Being able to provide information in the appropriate language, in accessible formats, and relevant to the resident's situation and needs is tremendously challenging. The regulatory and legislative environment is changing constantly, new services and opportunities receive funding at different times, and people's situations can change suddenly and dramatically. Our **Global API** provides an accurate set of housing related resources through access to HARS (Housing Advice and Resources Service) offering information and guidance to both residents and officers across seven different domains of support. So time can be best spent supporting priority cases and applying earlier stage engagement. 

Case management from the point of first contact
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For priority cases our **triage and assessment forms** can be conducted by the tenant or through assisted capture on the phone or in person to establish a case. This aids more effective case management, opening cases right from the point of first contact and automatically assessing needs during the process to deliver more effective recommendations, actions and decisions. To improve **data portability** and create quicker, more efficient and impactful referrals we are working with our partners across commmunity services, housing and local government to develop a comprehensive web service of sector and software **integrations**.

Early intervention and building better human relationships
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Although the advance of new technologies is exciting and offers many opportunities to help both residents and officers, these relationships are built on **trust and a consistent quality of engagement**. As interfaces change, and the ways in which we interact with one another evolve, we need to become more ambitious and creative with how we combat digital exclusion and respond to the needs of those most excluded, at risk and vulnerable. 

If you are interested in how our Tenancy Sustainment Tool works to support the **digital transformation of housing services**, whilst putting human relationships at the heart of our design principles and outcomes, please do get in touch. We are designing new systems with our partners that offer more holistic forms of continuous engagement, monitoring and referral, especially at the most difficult and stressful moments.
