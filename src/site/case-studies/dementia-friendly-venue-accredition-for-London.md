In response to the ‘postcode lottery’ of support on offer for people with dementia we worked with the GLA to design and deliver the Dementia Friendly Venues Charter, supporting hundreds of venues in becoming dementia friendly and ready to welcome those with dementia, their families and carers.

Developing inclusive programmes and venues
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dementia is one of the biggest health and social care challenges facing our society today. Just in London there are over 72,000 people with dementia, and this number is set to more than triple within the coming decades. Tremendous work is necessary to increase awareness of dementia and its impact, shift attitudes, tackle stigma, and convene and coordinate partners to act. 

The charter transforms cultural venues for people living with dementia and their carers through a range of dementia-friendly resources, and guides them in understanding how they can develop inclusive programmes and performances, dedicated relaxed sessions, clear signage, designated chill out zones and staff training. 

Working alongside the Alzheimer’s Society and the Museum of London the charter gives venues the opportunity to present dementia more effectively to their staff and volunteers, training them in how their venue offers support to those with dementia and improving their overall awareness in how to work with visitors that require specific access and support needs.

Building better touchpoints and datasets
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The tool creates an automated process for venues to register and become dementia friendly accredited. It also provides administrators with a range of data on audience numbers, and the reach and capacity to serve the local dementia community. This supports the business case for further investment into dementia related activities and helps highligh areas where there is a need for a more diverse range of engagement opportunities. 

In addition the tool provides officers with a real-time view of how venues are progressing through the accreditation process. Providing them with a range of touchpoints with individual organisations, or groups of organisations as they progress through the sections of the accreditation process. With this overview officers can organise their workload in delivering additional training and support, as well as continually report on the progress and growth of the charter and initiative as a whole. 

Building tailored training and accreditation environments
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We are working on making this environment available to support training and engagement in accessibility for all venues and in all geographic areas. If you are interested in bringing better training, accreditation or promotional environments to your users and networks then please do get in touch. We can tailor and customise the environment you need to deliver the best user experience and outcomes for your users.
